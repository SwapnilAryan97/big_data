# K-means implementation using mrjobs

Built a k-means map reduce class using mrjobs
1. Points with coordinates (x and y).
2. Coordinates for the initial centroids of the three clusters (K, x and y).

### Output file:
1. Coordinates for the new centroids after the two iterations.
2. Clustering results, i.e., which cluster each point belongs to.
